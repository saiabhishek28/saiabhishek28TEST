								<strong>IoT based Control System for Home Automation.</strong>  This research proposes the use IoT (Internet of Things) technology coupled with automation, 
                                to control hardware systems and peripherals through a custom-built web server. The embedded controller used in the proposed system is a Raspberry Pi 3b+. 
                                This system aims at making home automation and other related automated tasks simple to build, execute, automate and monitor the usage through the World Wide Web. 
                                By using the proposed system, it will help the end user to curb electricity costs, 
                                by monitoring and saving the units consumed by the different peripherals in the system, and also have a positive impact on the environment. <br>

								<strong>FANETs: An Application Driven Survey.</strong>  FANETs (Flying Ad-Hoc Networks) have been found to be useful for many fields such as 
                                agricultural tasks, military activities etc. In this research work, I have analyzed and suggested the most efficient protocol and models for each application. 
                                There are several existing routing protocols which have their own attributes. Since a single protocol cannot be used for all applications, 
                                every application will have different obstacles hence to counter each obstacle a different routing protocol will be useful in making the power 
                                consumption and message delivery much simpler, structured and hence enabling a much more efficient and easier completion of a given task. 
                                The work deals with the analysis of FANETs, 
                                the obstacles that come up with it and the most suitable protocols and their mobility models to achieve different tasks. <br>

                        graphFramework has the most commonly used algorithms pertaining to Graphs and Trees designed in such a way that it is easy to 
                        seamlessly implement multiple aglorithms and perform different operations on Graphs and Trees by calling one line functions. 
                        This reduces the redundancy in the project and by using my library a huge number of problems can be solved within one line.

                        using the concepts of Control Theory and Feedback mechanisms. In the end, I compared and analysed how ABS 
                        affects a vehicle in different environmental conditions. This modelling and designing were done using MATLAB and Simulink.

                        The system built was designed to identify the gender using the real time speech signal using MATLAB. 
                        The concept of correlation was used to find the Fundamental Frequency of the voice. The fundamental frequency, often referred to simply as the fundamental, is defined as the lowest frequency of a periodic waveform.
                        The assumption here is that male and female genders both have a specific range of Fundamental Frequency. Using that data, the system would be able to identify the gender of the 
                        speaker by analysing the voice in real-time. 
                        This project had an accuracy of 98.4%.
